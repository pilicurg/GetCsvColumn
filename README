A python library for extracting column(s) from a csv file by header name. Filters can also be applied like you do in Microsoft Excel. More than one column can be obtained at one time for unpacking.

There must be a header row in the csv file, however the first row will always be taken as the header row.

Usage: read and run the demo.py .
